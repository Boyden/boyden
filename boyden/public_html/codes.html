	<li><i>2008 - First Public Working Draft</i></li>
	WHATWG published the First Public Working Draft of the specification on 22 January 2008.

	<li><i>2011 - Last Call</i></li>
	On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation. In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" living standard to "HTML". The W3C nevertheless continued its project to release HTML5.

	<li><i>2012 - Candidate Recommendation</i></li>
	In July 2012, WHATWG and W3C decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered as a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.

	In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation. The criterion for advancement to W3C Recommendation is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations".

	<li><i>2014 - Proposed Recommendation and Recommendation</i></li>
	On 16 September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.
	On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation, bringing the specification process to completion.
	<li><i>Future plans</i></li>
	According to the plan proposed by the W3C in September 2012, the HTML 5.1 specification Recommendation will be targeted for the end of 2016.
